Pi Battery Usage

small number of experiments with batterry usage comparison between various Raspberry PI OS builds.

Problem statement:
Some builds have a lot of software, some of which take up more battery consumption than others, whilst this isnt really a problem for any Raspberry Pis that are always pluged-in. Thats said with todays electricity costs, maybe we should all try and be a little more efficent.

I have a Raspberry PI Zero W, with a Enviro+ (Environment sensor+Air Quality) hat 
Available from Pimoroni https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/enviro?variant=31155658457171
Currently running of a 10,000mah battery it lasts a couple of days, then needs to be swapped out.

Solution:
To 
A) Continue to use Raspberry-Pi, and evaluate ways to reduce power consumption.
B) To move away to an ESP powered device.

For the purposed of this phase, only looking at option A)

To evaluate various PI OS builds already available and do a comparison

There is an incredibly long list of available operating systems, dont need to try them all

These include:
1) Raspberry Pi OS (akaRaspbian)
2) Alpine Linux
3) Arch Linux ARM
4) DietPi
5) Raspup/Puppy Linux
6) Tiny Core Linux
7) Ubuntu for Raspberry Pi

Before I start, lets make sure we have memory cards available of the right size.
So how big are these operating systems anyway
